# Personal-Portfolio
The portfolio website was built to serve as a central hub for my professional presence online. It presents my journey in computer science and AI/ML, showcasing relevant academic achievements, certifications, and internships. Each section is tailored to give a quick overview of my capabilities, with neatly categorized content for easier navigation by recruiters or collaborators.

Beyond just listing qualifications, the site reflects my design sense and coding practice. Features like responsive layout, minimalist styling, and smooth interactivity aim to demonstrate not just what I know but how I apply it. By integrating visuals and concise text, the portfolio offers a dynamic glimpse into both my technical and creative sides.
