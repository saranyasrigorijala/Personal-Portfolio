          title: "Loan Approval Prediction – Smart decisions backed by data.",
          description:
            "This project predicts whether a loan should be approved based on user input data like income, credit history, and employment status. I used machine learning techniques to analyze historical loan data and build a classification model. The goal was to help automate and improve loan decision-making. The interface takes user details and gives a quick prediction. It’s a practical example of ML in financial services.",
          skills:
            "I used Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for building the model, with visualization through Matplotlib. A big challenge was dealing with missing values and class imbalance. I learned preprocessing techniques like encoding and imputation. Tuning the model taught me the impact of parameters on accuracy. This project boosted my data analysis and model evaluation skills.",

          title: "Hangman Game – A fun twist to coding basics.",
          description:
            "This is a Python-based version of the classic Hangman game, played in the terminal. The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word within limited tries. It tracks correct and incorrect guesses, giving instant feedback. The goal was to implement logic, loops, and conditions in an engaging way. It’s a simple yet rewarding game project.",
          skills:
            "I applied Python basics like loops, lists, conditionals, and string functions. Handling repeated guesses and wrong inputs was initially tricky. I learned how to structure programs cleanly and provide helpful messages to users. Debugging taught me patience and attention to detail. This helped strengthen my foundational coding skills.",

          title: "Restaurant Landing Page – Tastefully coded with design in mind.",
          description:
            "This is a static, responsive website designed for a restaurant to showcase its brand. It includes sections like menu, about, and contact, all styled with CSS. The layout is clean, user-friendly, and works across devices. The project aimed to create a web presence that’s both attractive and informative. It's a portfolio-ready UI sample.",
          skills:
            "I built it using HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, colors, and fonts. Making the site responsive was a challenge at first. I explored media queries and learned how to fix mobile layout issues. It taught me how small design choices impact user experience. This project improved my front-end development confidence.",

          description:
            "This project is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and background in a professional format. It includes sections like About Me, Projects, Resume, and Contact. The goal was to create a central hub to share my work with recruiters and peers. The site is simple, responsive, and easy to navigate. It represents who I am as a developer.",
          skills:
            "I used HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for structure and interactivity. Styling and layout alignment across screen sizes was initially challenging. I learned how to structure personal content in a clear and engaging way. It helped me understand responsive design and user interface thinking better. This portfolio has grown into my proudest ongoing project.",
